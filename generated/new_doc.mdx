Based on my exploration of the repository, this is a **DevScribe** documentation deployment template - a Next.js-based documentation platform with Markdoc support, AI-powered search using embeddings, and custom components. Let me create a concise one-pager:

## What is DevScribe?

DevScribe is a Next.js-based documentation platform for creating, managing, and deploying technical documentation with AI-powered search capabilities.

## Core Features

**Markdown & Components** - Write in Markdown with custom Markdoc components including callouts, cards, accordions, tabs, and code groups.

**AI-Powered Search** - RAG-based search using Gemini embeddings for context-aware answers. The chatbot retrieves relevant documentation and generates responses based on your content.

**Fast & Modern** - Built on Next.js 15 with React 19, Tailwind CSS, and optimized for performance with server-side rendering.

**Full-Text Search** - FlexSearch integration for instant keyword-based navigation through your documentation.

## Quick Start

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeSnippet language="bash" title="Install">
    npm install
  </CodeSnippet>
  
  <CodeSnippet language="bash" title="Setup">
    # Add Gemini API key to .env
    GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
  </CodeSnippet>
  
  <CodeSnippet language="bash" title="Run">
    # Generate embeddings and start dev server
    npm run generate-embeddings
    npm run dev
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeGroup>

## Architecture

**Content Management** - All documentation lives in `src/app/(pages)` as `.md` files with frontmatter for metadata.

**Build Process** - Generates search index and embeddings during build for optimal performance.

**Navigation** - Configured via `docs.json` with support for tabs, groups, and nested pages.

## Key Components

<Callout type="info">
DevScribe provides six callout types: `info`, `warning`, `error`, `success`, `tip`, `danger`.
</Callout>

**Code Groups** - Multi-language code examples with syntax highlighting and line numbers.

**Cards & CardGroups** - Organize content with flexible layouts (1-3 columns), icons, and links.

**Steps** - Sequential tutorials with rich content support including nested components.

## AI Search Flow

<Callout type="tip">
The AI search uses a three-step process to deliver accurate, context-aware answers from your documentation.
</Callout>

**1. Embed Documentation** - Run `npm run generate-embeddings` to process all `.md` files and store vectors in `data/embeddings.json`.

**2. User Query** - Questions submitted via the AskAI button are embedded using Gemini and compared against stored embeddings.

**3. Context Retrieval** - Most relevant documents are identified via dot product similarity and passed to Gemini 2.5 Flash for response generation.

## Deployment

<Callout type="success">
Deploy to Vercel with automatic builds. Embeddings and search index are regenerated on each deployment.
</Callout>

<CodeGroup>
  <CodeSnippet language="bash" title="Build">
    npm run build  # Generates embeddings, search index, and production build
  </CodeSnippet>
  
  <CodeSnippet language="bash" title="Start">
    npm start      # Runs production server
  </CodeSnippet>
</CodeGroup>

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Content**: Markdoc for enhanced Markdown
- **AI**: Google Gemini for embeddings and chat
- **Search**: FlexSearch for keyword search
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4 with Radix UI components
- **Syntax**: Shiki for code highlighting
