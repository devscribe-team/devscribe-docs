In circuits deep and code so brighties,
Where logic flows through endless night,
A cursor blinks, awaiting thought,
While algorithms dance, dreams are caught.

Through layers stacked of API calls,
Where data streams through virtual halls,
The engineer with steady hand,
Builds bridges to a digital land.

Each function pure, each loop refined,
A monument to structured mind,
In this realm where systems speak,
We find the answers that we seek.
