# Code and Keys

<Callout type="tip">
In silicon dreams, the circuits hum,
Where logic flows and functions run.
</Callout>

A thousand lines, a single thought,
The elegant solution, carefully wrought.

Through midnight hours, the cursor blinks,
A bridge between what is and what we think.

<Callout type="info">
In brackets, loops, and nested scopes,
We build tomorrow's brightest hopes.
</Callout>
