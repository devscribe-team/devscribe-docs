**Code and Keys**

Through silicon paths, the data flows,
Where logic lives and syntax grows.
A function called, a promise kept,
While errors caught are deftly swept.

In branches merged and commits made,
The builder's craft is displayed.
From bits to bytes, from thought to screen,
The digital world, serene, unseen.
