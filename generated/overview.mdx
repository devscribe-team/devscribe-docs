Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's a brief overview of the project:

## Overview

DevScribe Backend is a FastAPI-based platform that automatically generates documentation for software projects by analyzing GitHub repositories using AI. The system extracts code structures, generates intelligent documentation, and deploys it to custom documentation sites.

## Core Functionality

The platform processes GitHub repositories through an AI pipeline that:

- Analyzes codebases using Tree-sitter parsing to extract code chunks (functions, classes, components)
- Stores code embeddings in Milvus vector database for semantic search
- Generates documentation using LLMs with repository context
- Tracks code changes via GitHub webhooks and updates documentation automatically
- Deploys generated documentation to Vercel

## Key Features

**Repository Analysis**: Chunks code files into semantic units, builds call graphs, and performs complexity analysis to identify critical functions.

**AI Documentation Generation**: Creates internal docs, external docs, and API references by combining code analysis with LLM generation. Supports concurrent documentation generation with multi-threaded workers.

**GitHub Integration**: OAuth authentication, webhook-based change detection, and automatic repository syncing. Supports GitHub App installation for accessing user repositories.

**Change Tracking**: Monitors repository updates, identifies affected documentation, and stores changes in Google Cloud Storage for user review.

**Deployment**: Integrates with Vercel for automated documentation site deployment with custom domains and theming.

## Architecture

<Callout type="info">
The system is built on a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:
</Callout>

- **Routes**: Authentication (OAuth + password), GitHub operations, theme/logo customization, and AI endpoints
- **AI Features**: Modular services for chunking, vector search, documentation generation, call graph analysis, and repository processing
- **Database**: Firestore for user data, Milvus for vector embeddings, Google Cloud Storage for documentation artifacts
- **Middleware**: JWT-based authentication with session management

## Tech Stack

<Callout type="success">
Built with FastAPI, Tree-sitter for code parsing, Anthropic/OpenAI LLMs for generation, Milvus for vector storage, and integrates with GitHub API and Vercel deployment API.
