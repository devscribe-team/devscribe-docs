## Summary

PR #222 consolidated extensive staging changes into main, representing a major refactor and feature expansion of the Devscribe backend infrastructure.

### Key Changes

**Architecture Restructuring**
- Reorganized AI feature modules into specialized services: analysis, API, chunking, documentation, GitHub, LLM, repository, and vector operations
- Replaced legacy AI_old modules with new implementation
- Migrated from simple FastAPI app to more robust main.py with enhanced middleware

<Callout type="info">
This restructuring improves code organization and maintainability by separating concerns into dedicated service modules.
</Callout>

**Code Analysis & Chunking**
- Introduced Tree-sitter based code parsing for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python
- Added call graph analysis for tracking function dependencies
- Implemented complexity analysis and chunk modification system
- Created specialized parsers for different language constructs (js_base.py with 840 lines, python.py with 524 lines)

**API & Documentation**
- Built comprehensive API endpoint detection and documentation generation (endpoint.py with 742 lines)
- Added component linking system for tracking relationships between code elements
- Implemented structured LLM output handling for consistent AI responses

**Vector Database Integration**
- Integrated Milvus vector database for semantic code search (pymilvus.py with 947 lines)
- Added vector service layer for embedding and retrieval operations
- Implemented function call filtering and database chunk analysis

<Callout type="success">
Milvus integration enables powerful semantic code search capabilities, allowing developers to find relevant code based on meaning rather than just keywords.
</Callout>

**Infrastructure & DevOps**
- Added Docker support with Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml
- Introduced Justfile for task automation
- Set up comprehensive test suite with 27 new test files covering chunking, API detection, and vector operations
- Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing

**Authentication & Security**
- Enhanced auth middleware with health check endpoint
- Split auth routes into separate modules with OAuth support
- Implemented rate limiting and security utilities

<Callout type="warning">
Security enhancements include rate limiting and improved authentication mechanisms to protect the API from abuse.
</Callout>

**UI Enhancements**
- Expanded Streamlit app from minimal implementation to 1,828 lines
- Added theme customization routes (theme.py with 666 lines)
- Implemented logo upload functionality
- Enhanced Vercel deployment integration

**Developer Experience**
- Migrated to uv for faster dependency management (uv.lock with 2,978 lines)
- Updated requirements with new dependencies for Tree-sitter, Milvus, and Google GenAI
- Improved project documentation and .env.example

<Callout type="tip">
The migration to `uv` significantly speeds up dependency installation and resolution, improving developer productivity.
</Callout>

### Impact

<Callout type="success">
This PR added **25,499 lines** and removed **2,725 lines** across **122 files**, representing a complete platform evolution from a simple documentation tool to a sophisticated code analysis and documentation system with semantic search, AI-powered insights, and production-ready infrastructure.
