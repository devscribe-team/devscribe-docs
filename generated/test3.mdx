I'll write a short poem for you.

Here's a short poem:

**Code and Keys**

Fingers dance on plastic keys,
Building worlds from APIs.
Logic flows through midnight hours,
Debug, deploy, unlock the powers.

Functions nest, the variables climb,
Chasing bugs through space and time.
In the terminal's gentle glow,
Watch the elegant systems grow.

Commit, push, merge, deploy—
Creation brings its quiet joy.
