**Code and Words**

In circuits deep and functions bright,
We craft the logic, test, and write.
Through loops and branches, paths unfold,
Where documentation tells the story told.

Each commit holds a promise made,
Each pull request, a choice we weighed.
The terminal hums with purpose clear,
As engineers and words draw near.

From backend routes to frontend views,
We build the systems users use.
And when the code is clean and done,
The docs ensure that knowledge runs.
