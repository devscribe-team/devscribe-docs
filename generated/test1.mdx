In circuits deep and code so bright,
Where logic flows through day and night,
A developer sits with steady hand,
Building systems, line by line, as planned.

The terminal glows with commands true,
Each function crafted, tested through,
From bug to fix, from dream to deploy,
Creating tools that others enjoy.
